    <h1>U-Sync: Unifying  Event System</h1>
    <div class="section">
        <h2>Rationale</h2>
        <p>
            Educational Institutions and organizations has multiple departments under it, and social media has become its primary means of disseminating information. Each department has its own social media page, posting events and activities on their respective departments. This decentralized approach has led to fragmentation within the university or organization, resulting in less engagement with other departments on events. Additionally, the lack of a centralize calendar view exacerbates the issue, as social media platform lack structured information presentation, unfiltered content, and redundancy. Since there is no calendar view, participants may not prepare in advance due to not seeing the event weeks prior to the event. To address these challenges, we aim to design and develop U-Sync Unifying Events System to centralize event management with a calendar view of the events. 
U-Sync centralize and manage events to mitigate challenges associated with fragmentation. A centralize platform provides stakeholders with a view for all events across departments. Through a unified calendar view, users can quickly browse upcoming events, eliminating the need to scan through social media feeds.

U-Sync not only addresses the issue of fragmentation, it also promotes engagement and coordination among event management. By enabling admin to oversee the calendar and event manager or department heads to coordinate with the admin. It also provides advance notification of events to users, to have ample time to plan and prepare for events. With this structure of event information, it eliminates redundancy and ensures that users are presented  with relevant and timely updates.
